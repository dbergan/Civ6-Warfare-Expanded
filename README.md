# Civ6-Warfare-Expanded  -  What's this github for?
GitHub is a great free resource for a team of people to work together on a programming project in a transparent and organized way. The files for this mod are hosted here at GitHub so that anyone can easily make suggestions, fix bugs, or provide translations. If you're new to GitHub, here are the basics:

# These files are more up to date than the ones at Steam, how can I download them and use them in my game?

1) Go here: https://github.com/dbergan/Civ6-Warfare-Expanded
2) Click the Green "Clone or Download" button
3) Download ZIP
4) Extract the zip into a folder
5) Move the files into your Warfare Expanded folder such that they overwrite the existing files with the same names

My Warfare Expanded folder is here:
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\289070\1527621312

Yours may be in a slightly different location depending on how you set up Steam, but the part from \steamapps\ on should be the same.

# How do I suggest a simple change?

1) You will need a free github account. Create one here:
https://github.com/join

2) Once it's created and you've logged in, go here: https://github.com/dbergan/Civ6-Warfare-Expanded

3) Find the file where the change is to be made. For example, click on Text / en_US / WarfareExpanded_CivilopediaText.xml

4) Click the pencil icon on the top-left part of the code, now the code section will become editable

5) Make whatever changes you want to this file, then go to the bottom of the page

6) Here you fill out a title and extended description of what you did, then press the green "Propose file change" button

7) On the next page click the green "Create pull request" button. This means that you want the master codepage to "pull" your changes into it.

That's it! We automatically get a notification of the pull request and will merge it in at our convenience. If we have any questions, we'll let you know.


# How do I suggest a complex change?

1) You will need a free github account. Create one here:
https://github.com/join

2) Once it's created and you've logged into github, go here: https://github.com/dbergan/Civ6-Warfare-Expanded

3) Click the Fork icon in the top-right area of the page. What this does is copy all of the files from the master codepage into your own personal directory. Once you clicked that button, you'll notice in the top-left that it will say "MyUserName / Civ6-Warfare-Expanded" now instead of "dbergan / Civ6-Warfare-Expanded". You'll see the same change in the URL "https://github.com/MyUserName/Civ6-Warfare-Expanded".

4) Now you can edit any of the files that you want. Whatever you edit does not change the master codepage, just your own personal Fork. You edit files by clicking, for example, Text / en_US / WarfareExpanded_CivilopediaText.xml to bring up the file you want. And then click the pencil icon (top-right of the code section) to make the code section editable. When you're done editing, fill out the description title at the bottom of the code section and click the green "Commit changes".

5) Keep doing this until you've edited all the files that you need to. At any point in the process you can test your edits by clicking the "<> Code" tab and following the instructions from Step 2 onward in the first section above about getting the latest files.

6) Once you're sure that you have all the changes you want to make, create a "Pull Request". This means that you want the master codepage to "pull" your changes into it. To do this, you click the "<> Code" tab and then click the button on the left side next to Branch: master that says "New pull request".

7) On this next page, it should show all the differences between your Fork and the master codepage. If it looks good, click the green "Create pull request" button, then write a description of your changes, and again the green "Create pull request" button.

That's it! We automatically get a notification of the pull request and will merge it in at our convenience. If we have any questions, we'll let you know.
